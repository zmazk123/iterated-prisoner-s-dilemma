# Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

The iterated prisoner's dilemma is an extension of the general form except the game is repeatedly played by the same participants. An iterated prisoner's dilemma differs from the original concept of a prisoner's dilemma because participants can learn about the behavioral tendencies of their counterparty.

The theory behind the game has captivated many scholars over the years. More recently, organizational design researchers have used the game to model corporate strategies. The prisoner's dilemma is also now commonplace for game theories becoming popular with investment strategist. Globalization and integrated trade have further driven demand for financial and operational models that can describe geopolitical issues. 

The game is played iteratively for a number of rounds until it is ended (as if you are repeatedly interrogated for separate crimes). The scores from each round are accumulated, so the object is to optimize the point score before reaching game over. Game over is determined randomly anywhere between 1 and 100 rounds. At the end of the game, the scores are translated into percentages of the best possible scores.
